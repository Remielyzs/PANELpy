rFRC (rolling Fourier ring correlation) mapping and simplified PANEL (Pixel-level ANalysis of Error Locations) (w/o RSM) pinpointing. This repository will be in continued development. The full PANEL can be found in [PANELM](https://github.com/WeisongZhao/PANELM). If you find this useful, please cite the corresponding publication. [Weisong Zhao et al. Quantitatively mapping local quality of super-resolution microscopy by rolling Fourier ring correlation, <!-- Nature Biotechnology -->, X, XXX-XXX (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.01.518675).

## Usages of rFRC and PANEL in specific

The `rFRC` is for quantitatively mapping the local image quality (effective resolution, data uncertainty). The lower effective resolution gives a higher probability to the error existence, and thus we can use it to represent the uncertainty revealing the error distribution.

**rFRC is capable of:**
- **Data uncertainty mapping** of reconstructions without Ground-Truth (Reconstruction-1 vs Reconstruction-2) | 3σ curve is recommended;
- **Data uncertainty and leaked model uncertainty mapping** of deep-learning predictions of low-level vision tasks without Ground-Truth (Prediction-1 from input-1 vs Prediction-2 from input-2) | 3σ curve is recommended;
- **Model uncertainty mapping** of deep-learning predictions of low-level vision tasks without Ground-Truth (Prediction-1 from model-1 vs Prediction-2 from model-2) | 3σ curve is recommended;
- **Full error mapping** of reconstructions/predictions with Ground-Truth (Reconstruction/Prediction vs Ground-Truth) | 3σ curve is recommended;
- **Resolution mapping** of raw images (Image-1 vs Image-2) | 1/7 hard threshold or 3σ curve are both feasible;

**When two-frame is not accessible, two alternative strategies for single-frame mapping is also provided (not stable, the two-frame version is recommended).**  

**PANEL**

- In this plugin, `PANEL` is a `filtered rFRC` map, for biologists to qualitatively pinpoint regions with low reliability as a concise visualization

- Note that our `rFRC` and `PANEL` using two independent captures cannot fully pinpoint the unreliable regions induced by the model bias, which would require more extensive characterization and correction routines based on the underlying theory of the corresponding models.
